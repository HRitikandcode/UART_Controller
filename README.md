# UART_Controller
This repository contains a full-duplex UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) controller implemented in Verilog. The design is modular, featuring a dedicated baud rate generator, a state-machine-driven transmitter, and a robust receiver that utilizes 16x oversampling for reliable data capture.
